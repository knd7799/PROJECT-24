Things to be done: 
1. make a paper class
>> for the paper class: it will be an ellipse body
i have made this class for you so that you can do the other design---but you have to add it inside the index.html
2. make a dustbin class
>>made the dustbin class too 
it requires more technical things that we have to do in the coming classes
but you have to add it in the index.html
3. make a ground class >> same like the angry birds ground class (u can make this easily)
